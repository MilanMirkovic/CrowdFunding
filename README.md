# CrowdFunding

This is the project that I am currently working on. Backend is based on Java(Spring,Hibernate) while the frontent is Js(Angular), for the
database I am using MySQL. My main focus is on backend funcionality, didn't pay to much atention on web desing, altough I am using bootstrap for design.

As the project name says, the  idea is based on kickstarter website. So  you can search for the projects and if you like them you can donate,comment them but you must be logged in to do that. If you don't have account you can make one. You can add  project, also you can add FAQs on you project or editing them, or. Also you have update section, where you can inform people if there some changes on your project.
